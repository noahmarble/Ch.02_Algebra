HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. typed: Noah W. Mable

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
#this is how you make a single line comment



2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3 = .6666
/ = division
2 // 3 = 0
// = floor division, chops off the decimal
3/2 = 1.3333
/ = division
3//2 = 1
// = floor division. chops off the decimal






3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b = 35
use substitution, 22+13 = 35






4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle

a, it starts with a lower case abd is th shortest to type





5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2
1Apple
account number          this one it has a space in it
account_number
account.number
accountNumber
account#                cant have a hashtag
pi
PI
fred

GreatBigVariable
greatBigVariable
great_big_variable
great.big.variable       cant use periods
2x                       this one
x2x                      this one
total%                   this one
#left                    this one






6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2         a will equal 2
a*=10        a will equal 20
a/=2         a will equal 10.0
a+=12        a will equal 22.0
a-=7         a will equal 15.0
a            a will equal 15.0
type(a)      15.0







7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area


radius=10
pi=3.14
area=pi*radious**2
area



8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42)            <class 'int'>
type(42.0)          <class 'float'>
type("C3PO")        <class 'str'>
type(True)          <class 'bool'>







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)   need to add a * after the 3, a = 3*(x + y)
a






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3      need parentaces around x,y,z, ave = (x+y+z)/3
ave
